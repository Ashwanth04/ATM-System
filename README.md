The objective of this project is to design and develop an Automated 
Teller Machine (ATM) simulation system with integrated database 
functionality for secure and efficient banking operations. The system 
aims to provide users with essential features such as balance inquiry, 
cash withdrawal, and deposit transactions. It ensures the security of 
account access through authentication mechanisms. Real-time 
transaction data is logged into a MySQL database for record keeping 
and analysis. The project focuses on enhancing user experience with 
intuitive interfaces and detailed receipts. Additionally, it emphasizes 
modular and scalable code architecture for potential feature 
expansions. By leveraging Python for the application and MySQL for 
database management, the project ensures reliability and robustness. 
This project serves as a prototype for digital banking automation.
